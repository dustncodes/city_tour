    <h2>Google Analytics 4</h2>
    <p>If you have given your consent, this app uses Google Analytics 4, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC. The controller for users in the EU/EEA and Switzerland is Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland ("Google").</p>

    <h3>Nature and Purpose of the Processing</h3>

    <p>Google Analytics 4 has IP anonymisation enabled by default. Due to IP anonymisation, your IP address will be shortened by Google within Member States of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. According to Google, the IP address transferred by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.</p>

        <li>Referrer URL (the source from which you arrived at this app)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Purposes of Data Processing</h3>
    <p>On behalf of the operator, Google will use this information to evaluate your pseudonymous use of the app and to compile reports on app activity. The reports provided by Google Analytics 4 serve to analyze the performance of our app and the success of our marketing campaigns.</p>

    <h3>Recipients</h3>
    <p>Recipients of the data are/may be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (as processor under Art. 28 DSGVO)</li>
        <li>Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA</li>
        <li>Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third Country Transfer</h3>
    <p>For the USA, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision on July 10, 2023. Google LLC is certified under the EU-US Privacy Framework. Since Google servers are distributed worldwide and a transfer to third countries (e.g., Singapore) cannot be ruled out, we have also concluded EU standard contractual clauses with the provider to establish an appropriate level of data protection in those countries.</p>

    <h3>Retention Period</h3>
    <p>Data sent by us and linked to cookies are automatically deleted after 2 months. The maximum lifespan of Google Analytics cookies is 2 years. Data whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month.</p>

    <h3>Legal Basis</h3>
    <p>The legal basis for this data processing is your consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 p.1 lit.a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 p.1 TTDSG.</p>

    <h3>Withdrawal</h3>
    <p>You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future by accessing the data privacy settings and changing your selection. The lawfulness of processing carried out on the basis of consent until revocation remains unaffected.</p>

    <h2>Mapbox Integration</h2>
    <p>Our app uses Mapbox to provide essential map and location-based services. Mapbox is a service provided by Mapbox, Inc., located at 740 15th St NW, Washington, DC 20005, USA (“Mapbox”). This integration is necessary for core functionality within the app, allowing users to view and interact with maps.</p>

    <h3>Legal Basis for Data Processing</h3>
    <p>The use of Mapbox is based on our legitimate interest in providing essential mapping functionality (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Processing is limited to the minimum data necessary to provide these services.</p>

    <h3>Data Minimization and Telemetry</h3>
    <p>We have taken steps to configure Mapbox to limit data processing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Telemetry Disabled:</strong> Telemetry is disabled, so no analytics data on map interactions is collected.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cookies:</strong> We have configured the app to prevent Mapbox from setting cookies in the app’s WebView, so no tracking data is stored on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Data Processed by Mapbox</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Used for delivering map content. IP addresses are processed as required and not used to personally identify users. Raw logs with IP addresses are promptly deleted.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Only processed if location access is granted on your device, for in-app map functionality. Location data is not stored in personally identifiable form.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> Device type, operating system, and approximate location data (e.g., region or city) may be processed to optimize map functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third Country Transfer</h3>
    <p>Data transfers to Mapbox servers in the USA are covered by the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. Mapbox is certified under this framework, and additional EU standard contractual clauses (SCCs) are in place to protect data transfers outside the EU/EEA.</p>

    <h3>User Rights</h3>
    <p>Under GDPR, you have the right to access, rectify, delete, or restrict data processing, as well as the right to object to processing based on legitimate interest. Please contact the data protection officer for assistance.</p>

    <h3>Control Over Location Data</h3>
    <p>Mapbox requires location data only if you grant permission. You can control location access in your device settings. Without location data, certain map-based features may be limited.</p>

    <p>For more details on Mapbox’s data handling and compliance, refer to the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">Mapbox Privacy Policy</a> and the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy-framework" target="_blank">EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework</a>.</p>
