                    The story of <strong>"The Fork Man"</strong> (or <em>Gabelmoo</em> in Franconian dialect) is a fascinating part of Bamberg’s history. This iconic fountain was funded by Ludwig Krug, a Bamberg city councilman, whose legacy was brought back to the city in a smuggled salt wheel.

                    <p>
                    Commissioned in 1566 and featuring a statue of Neptune added in 1698, the fountain is affectionately named after Neptune’s trident, resembling a fork. Supplied by spring water from Stephansberg, it’s a true engineering marvel, with water flowing through wooden pipes across the city.

                    <strong>Schlenkerla</strong> is the most famous source of Bamberg’s unique <strong>Rauchbier</strong> (smoked beer). Brewed using traditional methods dating back to the Middle Ages, Schlenkerla continues the ancient practice of kilning malt over beechwood fires, giving the beer its distinctive smoky flavor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The name "Schlenkerla" comes from a 19th-century brewer who walked with a limp, giving rise to this Franconian nickname. Today, the brewery produces its smoked beer in a 600-year-old rock cellar beneath Stephansberg.
